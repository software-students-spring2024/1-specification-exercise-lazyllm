## Stakeholders

**Name: Tommy Age: 22 Background: NYU Student Senior** 

Q: What are your main goals when dealing with furniture as you prepare for graduation? 

A: "My main goal is to be able to sell my current furniture easily and to effectively communicate with buyers when I need to. It's all about simplifying the process and ensuring I can manage these transactions smoothly."

Q: Given that our app focuses on providing a communication platform rather than finding local furniture, how important is this feature to you?

A: "The communication aspect is crucial, especially if it's secure and streamlined. It can be challenging to coordinate sales and discuss details safely, so a dedicated platform that facilitates this would be incredibly valuable."

Q: What are some of the problems or frustrations you've faced with existing methods of selling or buying furniture?

A: "Safety and communication have been major issues. It's difficult to gauge the reliability of buyers or sellers, and coordinating pickups or deliveries can often be a hassle. Additionally, negotiating prices and details over less secure channels can be concerning."

Q: How could our app specifically address these issues for you?

A: "By providing a secure and user-friendly platform for communication, you'd be addressing a significant gap. If I can easily discuss details, negotiate prices, and arrange transactions all within the app, it would make the process much more efficient and safer."

**Tommy's Goals/Needs:**
- Ease of Use: Wants a straightforward, simple process for listing his furniture for sale and communicating with potential buyers.
- Secure Communication: Seeks a secure platform to discuss details and negotiate with buyers without compromising personal contact information.

**Tommy's Problems/Frustrations:**
- Safety Concerns: Worried about the safety of transactions, preferring a platform that ensures user verification or provides a rating system for reliability.
- Communication Barriers: Frustrated with platforms that donâ€™t offer a seamless way to communicate directly and securely within the app.
- Targeting Local Market: Has trouble reaching local buyers on general platforms, making it hard to sell large items like furniture.
